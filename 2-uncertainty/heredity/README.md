# **HEREDITY**

A Bayesian Network is formed in order to model the probabilistic relationships of inheriting a gene. Typically, a child inherits a gene from their parents. The purpose of the Bayesian Network, given information about the people, will be to determine whether the parent will pass on a gene, or the formation of a gene through mutation.
