# **PAGERANK** 

The PageRank algorithm was created by Google's co-founders. It determines if a website is more important if it is linked to by other important websites. Links from less important websites will have their links weighted less. Two implementations are created: Random-Surfer Model, and an Iterative, Recursive Algorithm.
