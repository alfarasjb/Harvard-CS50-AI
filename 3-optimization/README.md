Optimization primarily focuses on extending upon previously covered search problems. The main objective is to choose the best option from a set of possible options. This section further expands on search algorithms by exploring tools used to solve a broader range of problems. Local Search, Hill Climbing, Linear Programming, Constraint Satisfaction, and Backtracking are covered in the lecture.
