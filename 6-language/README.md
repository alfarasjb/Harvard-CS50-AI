# **LANGUAGE**

The final lecture consists of an introduction into Natural Language Processing (NLP), where an AI is given human language as an input. The lecture explores the construction of Phrase-Rules, Tokenization, n-grams, Markov Models, Naive-Bayes, and the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the role it plays in language recognition. 

The lecture is summed with the basics of Attention, and an introduction into Transformers.
